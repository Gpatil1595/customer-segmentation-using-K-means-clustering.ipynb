# customer-segmentation-using-K-means-clustering.ipynb
1- INTRODUCTION

This project focuses on performing customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation allows businesses to understand customer behavior and group them based on common attributes, enabling targeted marketing strategies and better customer service.

2- OBJECTIVE

- Identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior.
- Apply K-Means Clustering for unsupervised segmentation.
- Visualize customer groups using dimensionality reduction (PCA/t-SNE).

3- DATA SET

- Dataset Name: Mall Customer Segmentation Data
- Source: [Kaggle Link or UCI Repository]
- Features:
  - CustomerID
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Annual Income (k$)
  - Spending Score (1-100)

 4-LIBRARIES USED

 - pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

5- STEPS PERFORMED

1. Data Loading and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Selection and Scaling
4. Optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method)
5. Applying K-Means Algorithm
6. Visualizing the Segmented Customers

6- RESULTS

- Created 5 distinct customer segments.
- Visualized clusters in 2D space using PCA.
- Insights gained from clusters (e.g., High spenders, Young customers, etc.)
